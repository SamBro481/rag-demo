      "aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\n",
      "self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\n",
      "3 ModelArchitecture\n",
      "Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29].\n",
      "Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,xn) to a sequence\n",
      "of continuous representations z = (z1,...,zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\n",
      "sequence (y1,...,ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\n",
      "[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n",
      "The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\n",
      "connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\n",
      "respectively.\n",
      "3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\n",
      "Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\n",
      "sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position\n",
      "2\n",
      "Figure 1: The Transformer- model architecture.\n",
      "wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [10] around each of\n",
      "the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\n",
      "LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\n",
      "itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\n",
      "layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\n",
      "Decoder: Thedecoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\n",
      "sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\n",
      "attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\n",
      "around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\n",
      "sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\n",
      "masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\n",
      "predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n",
      "3.2 Attention\n",
      "An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\n",
      "where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\n",
      "of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\n",
      "query with the corresponding key.\n",
      "3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n",
      "We call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\n",
      "queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\n",

      "Figure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\n",
      "attention layers running in parallel.\n",
      "query with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\n",
      "values.\n",
      "In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\n",
      "into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\n",
      "the matrix of outputs as:\n",
      "Attention(Q,K,V ) = softmax(QKT\n",
      "√\n",
      "dk \n",

      "(1)\n",
      "The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi\n",
      "√\n",
      "plicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\n",
      "of 1\n",
      "dk \n",
      ". Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\n",
      "a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\n",
      "much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\n",
      "matrix multiplication code.\n",
      "While for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\n",
      "dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\n",
      "dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\n",
      "extremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1\n",

      "√\n",
      "dk \n",
      ".\n",
      "Instead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\n",
      "we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\n",
      "linear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\n",
      "queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\n",
      "output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\n",
      "depicted in Figure 2.\n",
      "Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\n",
      "subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\n",
      "4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\n",
      "variables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = dk\n",

      "In this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\n",
      "dk = dv =dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\n",
      "is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n",
      "3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\n",
      "The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n",
      "• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\n",
      "and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\n",
      "position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\n",
      "typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n",
      "[31, 2, 8].\n",
      "• Theencoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\n",
      "and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\n",
      "encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\n",
      "encoder.\n",
      "• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\n",
      "all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\n",
      "information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\n",
      "inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\n",
      "of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n",
      "3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n",
      "In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\n",
      "connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\n",
      "consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n",
      "FFN(x) = max(0,xW1 +b1)W2 +b2\n",
      "(2)\n",
      "While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\n",
      "from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\n",
      "The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\n",
      "dff = 2048.\n",
      "3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\n",
      "Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\n",
      "tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor\n",
      "mation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\n",
      "our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\n",
      "linear transformation, similar to [24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\n",
      "3.5 Positional Encoding\n",
      "Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\n",

      "4 WhySelf-Attention\n",
      "In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu\n",
      "tional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\n",
      "(x1,..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1,...,zn), with xi,zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\n",
      "layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\n",
      "consider three desiderata.\n",
      "One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\n",
      "be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n",
      "The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\n",
      "dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\n",
      "ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\n",
      "traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\n",
      "and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also compare\n",
      "the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\n",
      "different layer types.\n",
      "Asnoted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\n",
      "executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\n",
      "computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n",
      "length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\n",
      "sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\n",
      "[31] and byte-pair [25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\n",
      "very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\n",
      "6\n",
      "the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\n",
      "path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n",
      "Asingle convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\n",
      "positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\n",
      "or O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [15], increasing the length of the longest paths\n",
      "between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\n",
      "recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\n",
      "considerably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\n",
      "convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\n",
      "the approach we take in our model.\n",
      "Asside benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\n",
      "from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\n",
